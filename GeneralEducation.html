				<h4>Short term goals and long term goals</h4>
				<p>I would prefer to get a job with a company where I can do industrial level testing and 
				work on projects that will be used in the world around us. I want to engineer the infastructure 
				of America. I know that my first few years out of college will involve a lot of practical learning
				so I would be happy to work with whoever will mold me into a better developer.
				
				My long term goals are to work in a company in the Midwest or the West Coast. I want to eventually lead
				a small team of tester to verify that the products my company is making are of good quality.</p>
				<h4>How my general education helps me as a software engineer</h4>
				<p>My general electives have been focused on mainly psychology and economics. Psychology helps
				me understand people so that I can clearly communicate with them and understand what it is they are
				trying to communicate. Since people come from many different backgrounds and thought processes
				the more I understand them the better we'll be able to work together. Economics allows my to always have 
				the big picture in mind as I consider the detials of how my work will effect the company and the market. 
				economics is closely tied with business of all kinds so it is only natural that I learn it 
				and learn it well to be successful in my future workplace.</p>
				<h4>Specific instances where I used my general education in engineering</h4>
				<p>In my first internship I was still learning the finer points of coding. I realized that since I was 
				paid about half of what my mentor made it would only be worth it to ask him for help if he could explain 
				a concept in one hour that would take me over three to grasp. The reason for this is because one hour of him
				explaining and me listening would cost the company the same if I took 3 hours on my own to understand the
				concept. By understanding this I was able to be efficient with my time and give the company the most value per 
				paycheck I could.</p>
