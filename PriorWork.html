				<h2>Freshman year: Choose your own adventure: The Hob's Bit</h2>
				<p>In this project I was paired with another developer to create an end of the 
				year project in C. Using the Windows graphic library we created a click based game
				that took the user on an adventure that presented them with choices that lead them 
				down different paths based on their answers. It also had several minigames throughout
				the story to add skill challege to the players. My role is this project was lead developer and 
				story board architect. My partner was the graphic designer and second developer. He made the 
				scenes for the the story and created some minigames as well.</p>
				<p>I also created this trailer for the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulBN6nL33dk</p>
				<h2>Junior year: 309 team project: Zombie Tactics</h2>
				<p>The goal of this project was to create a game that would use sockets, a database, and 
				teach us (the students) how to collaborate with others and use a repository for our code base.
				I worked three others developers on my team. I was the database expert. The other roles were 
				networking specialist, game mechanics lead, and team leader.<p>
				<p>I was in charge of making the promo video for this project too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lHacMTJrXA </p>
